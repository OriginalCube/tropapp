This is a social media website that's similiar to twitter. This website allows users to create their own account, post, follow other accounts to see their post on their homepage, 
and message each other and create rooms to talk to people. This website is also the combination of my two previous MERN stack app which are Usapp (messaging app) and Kitapp (post app).

## Dev notes
This project helped me understand how MERN stack fully works. It learned how easily other websites without encryption can steal your information, and the importance of using libraries that can make your life easier
and focus on developing the things that are important. This is also one of the few website that I tried to make a responsive design which helped me get a better understanding in web design.

## Time took to complete
July 3 - 16
This was a project that was done pretty fast because it's just a reworked version of my 2 previous work.

## Tools used
MongoDB for database
Express for backend
React JS for front-end
Node JS for backend
